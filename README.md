## UX
Below the structure and how the website is planed will be presented using the five scopes of UX.

### 1 Strategy 
The main reason for this website is to create an online presence for the company and to give information about the company and the product 
they are selling. The main USP for the company is that they have vegan oat-based and gluten free ice cream and therefor it is important to 
premiere this content on the website. The structure of the website needs to be easy so that the user immediately understands how to use the 
website and its purpose. The main target audience will be people who eats a plant-based diet or wants to eat a more plant-based diet. Since 
the site is B2C there will be large images and illustrations on the website and small chunks of content to make the website compelling and to 
feel overloaded with content for the users.
