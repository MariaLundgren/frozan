## UX
Below the structure and how the website is planed will be presented using the five scopes of UX.

### 1 Strategy 
The main reason for this website is to create an online presence for the company and to give information about the company and the product 
they are selling. The main USP for the company is that they have vegan oat-based and gluten free ice cream and therefor it is important to 
premiere this content on the website. The structure of the website needs to be easy so that the user immediately understands how to use the 
website and its purpose. The main target audience will be people who eats a plant-based diet or wants to eat a more plant-based diet. Since 
the site is B2C there will be large images and illustrations on the website and small chunks of content to make the website compelling and to 
feel overloaded with content for the users.

### 2 Scope
Site ownersâ€™ goal: To create an online presence and inform about the company, the product, and location.

User goals: Get information about the company, the product and where the ice cream shops are available.

To prioritize between what would be included on this website I first wrote down ideas of what 
could be included and then I made an Importance and Viability/feasibility chart to determine what ideas to 
include in this version and what could be potential features for the future. The ideas in the grey box are 
the one that will be included in this version and the other could be included in future versions. The user
stories were written based on the ideas that are in the grey box in the chart. 
- Importance and Viability/feasibility chart

User stories 
-	As a user I want to get information about the company.
-	As a user I want to get information about the ice cream product the company is selling. 
-   As a user I want to know what flavours of the ice cream the company offers. 
-	As a user I want to be able to contact the company with questions and feedback. 
-	As a user I want to know where the ice cream shops are located. 
-   As a user I want to see on where the map the ice cream shops are located. 
-	As a user I want to be able to find the social channels of the company. 

### 3 Structure 
The structure will have a linear narrative so that it is easy for the user to 
use the website from the start, and this is important so that it will not be
confusing for someone who visits the website for the first time to find the 
information that they need. The most important content will be presented first
on the webpage and content to get the user interested, then moving down the 
website more specific information will be presented.

### 4 Skeleton
That the company sells vegan oat-based ice cream will be the first thing 
presented on the website since this is the information that are the most 
prioritized on the webpage. Then moving down the structure more specific 
content about the company, flavors, locations and at the end a contact 
form for the customers who wants to contact the company will be presented.

The website has a lot of whitespace in the design, and this is both to 
make the design mor minimalistic and less cluttered but also because to 
have a few features increases the usability which is highly prioritized 
on the website. 

Figma were used to create the wireframes that are linked below.

### 5 Surface

#### Colors
The color palette chosen for this project is soft to match the theme of 
icecream and feel fun. The pink color beeing the strongest is used sparsingly 
throug the design to direct attention to sertain elements and the dark grey
color is used for text to have a good legibility but still be softer than 
a pure black color for the font.

#### Typography 
Both fonts chosen for this project is found on Google fonts, Quicksand
is used for the logo and for the rest of the text Open Sans is used since 
it is a font that suits the web and have good legibility. The fallback 
font is Sans Seriff.

### Bugs

- When using d-flex on the logo in the footer to get it to be aligned to the left on desktop but in the center 
on smaller screen sizes the image loses it integrity and get stetched out. 
- The bootstrap class sticky-top didn't work on the navbar and I couldnt find a reason to this so implemented the fixed position to the navbar in my css document
instead to make the navbar sticky.
