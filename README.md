## UX
Below the structure and how the website is planed will be presented using the five scopes of UX.

### 1 Strategy 
The main reason for this website is to create an online presence for the company and to give information about the company and the product 
they are selling. The main USP for the company is that they have vegan oat-based and gluten free ice cream and therefor it is important to 
premiere this content on the website. The structure of the website needs to be easy so that the user immediately understands how to use the 
website and its purpose. The main target audience will be people who eats a plant-based diet or wants to eat a more plant-based diet. Since 
the site is B2C there will be large images and illustrations on the website and small chunks of content to make the website compelling and to 
feel overloaded with content for the users.

### 2 Scope
 
Site ownersâ€™ goal: To create an online presence and inform about the company, the product, and location.

User goals: Get information about the company, the product and where the ice cream shops are available. 

User stories 
-	As a user I want to get information about the company.
-	As a user I want to get information about the product the company is selling. 
-	As a user I want to be able to contact the company with questions and feedback. 
-	As a user I want to know where the ice cream shops are located. 
-   As a user I want to see on where the map the ice cream shops are located.
-	As a user I want to know the opening hours of the ice cream shops. 
-	As a user I want to be able to find the social channels of the company. 

### 3 Structure 
The structure will have a linear narrative so that it is easy for the user to 
use the website from the start, and this is important so that it will not be
confusing for someone who visits the website for the first time to find the 
information that they need. The most important content will be presented first
on the webpage, that the company sells vegan oat-based ice cream and then moving 
down the structure more specific content about the company, flavors, locations 
and at the end a contact form for the customers who wants to contact the company 
will be presented.
