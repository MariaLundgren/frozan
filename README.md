[Link to the website](https://marialundgren.github.io/frozan/)

This website is created for an ice cream company called frozan. The purpose of the website is to create an online presence for the company to have a space 
where customers can get information about the comany and the product, see where the shops are located and be able to contact the company if they want to.
The company and project are fictional and only created for educational purpose. 

## UX
Below the structure and how the website is planed will be presented using the five scopes of UX.

### 1 Strategy 
The main reason for this website is to create an online presence for the company and to give information about the company and the product 
they are selling. The main USP for the company is that they have vegan oat-based and gluten free ice cream and therefor it is important to 
premiere this content on the website. The structure of the website needs to be easy so that the user immediately understands how to use the 
website and its purpose. The main target audience will be people who eats a plant-based diet or wants to eat a more plant-based diet. Since 
the site is B2C there will be large images and illustrations on the website and small chunks of content to make the website compelling and to 
feel overloaded with content for the users.

### 2 Scope
Site owners’ goal: To create an online presence and inform about the company, the product, and location.

User goals: Get information about the company, the product and where the ice cream shops are available.

To prioritize between what would be included on this website I first wrote down ideas of what 
could be included and then I made an Importance and Viability/feasibility chart to determine what ideas to 
include in this version and what could be potential features for the future. The ideas in the grey box are 
the one that will be included in this version and the other could be included in future versions. The user
stories were written based on the ideas that are in the grey box in the chart. 
- Importance and Viability/feasibility chart

User stories 
-	As a user I want to get information about the company.
-	As a user I want to get information about the ice cream product the company is selling. 
-   As a user I want to know what flavours of the ice cream the company offers. 
-	As a user I want to be able to contact the company with questions and feedback. 
-   As a user I want to know the opening hours of the ice cream shops. 
-	As a user I want to know where the ice cream shops are located. 
-   As a user I want to see on where the map the ice cream shops are located. 
-	As a user I want to be able to find the social channels of the company. 

### 3 Structure 
The structure will have a linear narrative so that it is easy for the user to 
use the website from the start, and this is important so that it will not be
confusing for someone who visits the website for the first time to find the 
information that they need. The most important content will be presented first
on the webpage and content to get the user interested, then moving down the 
website more specific information will be presented.

### 4 Skeleton
That the company sells vegan oat-based ice cream will be the first thing 
presented on the website since this is the information that are the most 
prioritized on the webpage. Then moving down the structure more specific 
content about the company, flavors, locations and at the end a contact 
form for the customers who wants to contact the company will be presented.

The website has a lot of whitespace in the design, and this is both to 
make the design mor minimalistic and less cluttered but also because to 
have a few features increases the usability which is highly prioritized 
on the website. 

Figma were used to create the wireframes that are linked below.

### 5 Surface

#### Colors
The color palette chosen for this project is soft to match the theme of 
icecream and feel fun. The pink color beeing the strongest is used sparsingly 
throug the design to direct attention to sertain elements and the dark grey
color is used for text to have a good legibility but still be softer than 
a pure black color for the font.

### Bugs

- When using d-flex on the logo in the footer to get it to be aligned to the left on desktop but in the center 
on smaller screen sizes the image loses it integrity and get stetched out. I fixed this by setting a fixed height to the logo in the footer and the widt to auto so that 
the logo don't change size when the sreen does but stay at the same size all the time. I read a bit about this problem and it seem that you have to give an image a set size if you but it in a flex container to not stretch to cover the containers width.
- The bootstrap class sticky-top didn't work on the navbar. I read on stack overflow that this colud be a problem if you hav the navbar in a div or section instead of nav but since i didn't have that I couldnt find a reason for this. To fix this I implemented the fixed position to the navbar in my css document
instead to make the navbar sticky.
- My google maps map was loading but i got an error message in devtools saying that the initMap() wasn't a function. I found another person that seemd to have a similar problem it was suggested that he take away the async from the script loading the api because it made a problem with the callback function. But then I got another error message saying that google was not defined wich I solved by using the window onload event to make it wait until the whole page was loaded.
